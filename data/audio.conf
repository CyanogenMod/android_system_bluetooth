# Configuration file for the audio service

# This section contains options which are not specific to any
# particular interface
# NOTE: Enable=Sink means that bluetoothd exposes Sink interface for remote
# devices, and the local device is a Source
[General]
Enable=Sink,Control
Disable=Headset,Gateway,Source

# Switch to master role for incoming connections (defaults to true)
Master=false

# If we want to disable support for specific services
# Defaults to supporting all implemented services
#Disable=Control,Source

# SCO routing. Either PCM or HCI (in which case audio is routed to/from ALSA)
# Defaults to HCI
#SCORouting=PCM

# Automatically connect both A2DP and HFP/HSP profiles for incoming
# connections. Some headsets that support both profiles will only connect the
# other one automatically so the default setting of true is usually a good
# idea.
#AutoConnect=true

# Headset interface specific options (i.e. options which affect how the audio
# service interacts with remote headset devices)
#[Headset]

# Set to true to support HFP (in addition to HSP only which is the default)
# Defaults to false
#HFP=true

# Maximum number of connected HSP/HFP devices per adapter. Defaults to 1
#MaxConnections=1

# Set to true to enable use of fast connectable mode (faster page scanning)
# for HFP when incomming call starts. Default settings are restored after
# call is answered or rejected. Page scan interval is much shorter and page
# scan type changed to interlaced. Such allows faster connection initiated
# by a headset.
FastConnectable=false

# Just an example of potential config options for the other interfaces
